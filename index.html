      <h1 class="about-info-heading">My solution to Cliamte Change : Introduction</h1>
      <p class="about-info-desc">My solution to climate change is to create all plastics plant derived plastics. To do that I would need to create biodiesel so that it doesn't use diesel which contributes to climate change. The manufacturing and disposal of plastic is one of the biggest contributors to climate change. Plastic is now a part of a normal human being's life. Every Single thing that a human does includes some type of plastic. Bio-plastics are a very good option and alternative to plastics. Plastics don’t just create and contribute to climate change because of the pollution problem however also because of the amount of factories there and the amount of carbon and greenhouse gasses that they emit.I think that this is a solution worth addressing because of the plastics is one of the biggest contributors towards climate change and I think that by reducing or completely replacing plastic with bio-plastics will really help our motive and movement to stop and slow down climate change. Bio-plastics are also biodegradable which helps nature and the soil greatly. Instead of the plastic that is worn out or just thrown in the garbage going into a landfill which never decomposes, the bio-plastics will really help the landfill disaster that we have in our world right now.Another question that someone might ask or a question that might come up will be, what will we do with the plastics that we have right now. For the plastics that we have right now, there is a new research that developed in Australia that has found a new method to create biodiesel with plastics and bioplastics.

One of the relations is that the pollution of plastics in waterways can be reduced and maybe permanently stopped by inducting nature rights to make sure that no public attractions or tourism is permitted in these areas. </p>

          <p class="about-info-desc">I found a wonderful sentence that Catia said in an interview”The millennium challenge for innovation lies in the search for development models capable of conserving the plants resources while preserving and increasing the quality of life of its inhabitants.”
            <p class="about-info-desc">At that time, she helped found the research center that would later become Novamont, being responsible for the strategy and specific activities in the biomaterials sector. She strongly believed that science and technology could improve the world and people’s lives. However, since the beginning, she has been persuaded that any innovation and technology, even the best kinds, can have negative effects unless they are developed with the required wisdom, especially when renewable raw materials are concerned. She then decided, starting from bioplastics, to devote all her efforts to experimenting with a systemic approach, which could create added value and reduce environmental impact, to reconvert no longer competitive and polluted industrialized sites, and to recreate opportunities for territories and skilled employment. The Italian territories were, for her team and me, open-air laboratories through which to grow a new inclusive and shared culture and in which to verify the quality standards directly on the field.The future of Catia Bastioli is really bright. 
              <p class="about-info-desc">She is THE biggest bioplastics innovator and spokesperson. She has really revolutionized the industry of bioplastics. The company of Novamont and Catia Bastioli have had an insane amount of success throughout the years. However it doesn't stop here for her and her company. Catia Bastioli has a lot of innovative ideas to not only better bioplastics, but to invent new ideas to better the world in different ways. Some ideas that Catia Bastioli has made is the new idea of Mater-Bi bioplastic.
